<h2>Hi, I'm Tiago 👋</h2>

I'm a Frontend Developer with a Master's Degree in Architecture.  
Currently focused on building full-stack web applications with **React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase**  
(frontend-focused, with backend experience using Next.js API routes and Supabase for database/auth).
